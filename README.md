# radiology-report-summarization
This project develops an interactive system for radiologists to query and summarize radiology reports using LLMs (Ollama via LM Studio). It integrates SQL Server (pyodbc) for data storage and Gradio for a user-friendly interface. Future enhancements include MIRTH and DORIS for data expansion.
